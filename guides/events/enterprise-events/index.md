# Enterprise Events

Enterprise events provide an event feed for all users and content in an enterprise Box instance. Depending upon the `stream_type` your application can either subscribe to live events or query historical events. Access to these stream types is limited to users with admin permissions to **Run new reports and access existing reports**.
